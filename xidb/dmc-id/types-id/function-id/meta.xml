A function document specifies an interface in terms of base context, input context and output context

The base context is the set of definitions required by the function
The input context is a set of definitions provided by the caller
This includes the formal parameters of the function, some required and some optional
The input context may also include definitions that override the base context
The output context is generated by the function, minimally a return value
but may also include errors and exceptions, profiling information, side effect logging, etc

The document also specifies:

- documentation (vid to web site with links to support and dev communities)
- implementation(s)
