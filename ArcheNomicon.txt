start xidb with ArcheNomicon

create the ArcheNomicon project on github
commit the following docs:

1 ArcheNomicon Rules (empty)
2 user David McFadzean (head link)
3 Prop 1: microNomicon seed rule 1 sponsored by me
4 vote 1 (refs Prop 1, inits my vote to 0.5)
5 revise vote 1, changing my vote to 1
6 revise Rules, add seed rule 1
7 repeat 3-6 for seed rules 2, 3, 4
8 start adding xidb rules
9 start adding source code to implement rules
10 revise this plan as we learn, and to keep of record of how xidb evolved
11 repeat 8-10 until xidb comes to life (so that the System contains its own source code and development policy)

----

At some point in the future the xidb project can fork from ArcheTech, separating the private and public organizations
or it may be simpler to add rules to Archetech for how to spawn a new instance of the Nomicon, with only general rules included.

Document headers should contain

	* last revision id of current version (so all future programs can tell which version of ArcheNomicon to use to interpret the document)
	* publisher (group ID or single user ID)
	* authors (group ID or a single user ID)
	* timestamp


eventually Documents will be published (digitally signed) by the publisher and the notarized (digitally signed) by the System
perhaps all members of a Group will have access to the group's private key so that Documents signed with the group;s public key can only be viewed by members of the Group
