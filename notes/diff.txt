The System will have to be able to display the difference between any 2 Documents

If one Document is an ancestor of the other than it is fairly easy to show all the step involved in changing one to the other

If the Documents are the same type (e.g. text files, image files) then an off-the-shelf difference can be used

If the Documents are different types, can we discover a transform to convert them to the same type before comparing?

If not, what can we glean from the metadata? 

	* Different authors?
	* Different publishers?
	* Different publication dates?
