Anyone can publish a new revision of a document just by forking it.
When a document is forked, it gets a new owner.

However only authorized IDs can publish an official new revision of a document (new HEAD)
The document itself will contain permissions and voting procedures.
The owner of a Document is an ID which may be an individual or a group
The revision permissions will specify who can start a vote and what kind of votes are possible

In the simplest case the Document will be owned by an individual in which case the vote is by fiat, i.e. the owner may publish a new revision just by specifying the new Document

The next simplest case is when the Document is owned by a group where anyone is the group can publish a new revision by fiat.

More complex votes are easily possible:

	* unanimous vote
	* majority vote
	* 2/3 vote
	* majority vote with a subset of the group having veto power
	* majority vote where some members get extra votes
	* meridion vote where voting weight depends on reputation

	
A vote is a program that automatically revises a document when specific conditions are met 

Membership changes should be done through special votes:

Invitation
