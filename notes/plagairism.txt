Anyone can clone any Document, provided they keep a reference to the original

If someone copies the Document without attribution, the System will make it easy to detect the plagiarism by comparing Documents

For example it will show that Document A was published before Document B, yet B has no attribution and the differences are too small (as defined by the rules against plagiarism)
