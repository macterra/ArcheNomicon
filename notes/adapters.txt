xish
knows how to load and run other adapters


e.g. verbatim adapater:

<head>
</head>
<body>
     <name>verbatim</name>
     <type>application/xidb-adapter</type>
     <description>output = input</description>

     <platforms>
          <platform>
               <os>Ubuntu 10.4</os>
               <vm>XID of vm</vm>
               <path>/bin/cat</path>
               <executable>XID of cat program doc</executable>
               <command-line>%PATH < %XID</command-line>
          </platform>
          <platform>
               <os>windows 7</os>
               <command-line>path to cat-like executable %XID</command-line>
          </platform>
     </platforms>
<body>

The idea is that the adapter Doc will contain enough info and links for the System to 
be able to execute a specific version of the program on any supported platform.
The Document may (should?) also contain all info needed to rebuild the executable from source.

The executable will likely be cached, but if it hasn't been used for too long it may have been garbage collected.
Then the system can retrieve the binary as a Document, or possibly load a vm with the right infrastructure.
The System will run the program, streaming the Document to the stdin and capturing the stdout as output.
