Instead of voting on propositions as documents separate from the rules,
maybe vote on rule revisions.

1. Fork the rules
2. Change what you want to propose
3. Vote to adopt the revised rules

Voters will typically vote on diffs
Diffs should be small and localized e.g. 

	* adding a single rule
	* amending a single rule
	* repealing a single rule

Where does commentary go?

Or create a proposal doc
Fork original
Merge the two
Discuss the proposal (adding comment pubs)
Revise the proposal
Remerge and revise until acceptable
Vote on the final merge
